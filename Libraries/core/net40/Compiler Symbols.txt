dotNetRDF Compiler Symbols
==========================

The dotNetRDF library codebase contains the following compiler symbols, defining these symbols with the define command of your compiler will have the following effects:

Profile Symbols
---------------

These symbols are used to target a specific profile

MONO

Compile for Mono runtime

SILVERLIGHT

Compile for Silverlight runtime

WINDOWS_PHONE

Compile for Windows Phone 7 runtime, if you define this you should also define SILVERLIGHT


Feature Symbols
---------------

These symbols are used to disabled various features of the library, these are used in conjunction with a profile symbol to build a specific variant of the dotNetRDF library

NO_ASP

Compile without building the VDS.RDF.Web namespace which provides the ASP.Net integration.  Using NO_WEB will also cause these features to be excluded

NO_COMPRESSIOn

Compile without using any System.IO.Compression dependencies.  Will exclude GZip related functionality

NO_DATA

Compile without any System.Data dependency and without any SQL features.  Will exclude Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and Virtuoso support and all classes that dependent on these features.  Using NO_STORAGE will also cause these features to be excluded

NO_NORM

Compile without any use of String.Normalize() - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported

NO_PROCESS

Compile without any use of System.Diagnostics.Process - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported

NO_PROXY

Compile without any use of WebProxy - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported

NO_RWLOCK

Compile without any use of ReaderWriterLockSlim - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported.  Will cause all thread safe classes that depend on this to be excluded from the build

NO_SYNC_HTTP

Compile without support for features that require synchronous HTTP which is not supported on profiles like SILVERLIGHT

NO_STOPWATCH

Compile without any use of Stopwatch - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported

NO_URICACHE

Compile without the caching features of the UriLoader

NO_XMLDOM

Compile without any use of XmlDocument and the XML DOM API - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported but other XML APIs are supported
