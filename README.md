### Obtaining dotNetRDF

dotNetRDF produces two main products:

 - A Programmers API for working with RDF and SPARQL in code using .Net
 - A Toolkit which provides an assortment of GUI and command line tools for working with RDF and SPARQL on Windows platforms

The Programmers API requires .Net 3.5 or higher (builds are provided for a variety of different framework versions and profiles) and can be obtained as either a [Binary Download][20] or a [Source Download][21].  The [Source Download][21] represents the source for the current [Binary Download][20], if you want the latest source obtain it from our Mercurial repositories which you are viewing now or can be found listed further down this file.

The Toolkit requires .Net 4.0 Full and can be obtained either as a [ZIP Download][25] or as a [Windows Installer Download][26]

## Source Code

The dotNetRDF Project uses Mercurial as our VCS.

Currently we our maintaining the following repositories as our official repositories.  We use BitBucket
for our day to day development and periodically push changes to the repositories at SourceForge which
we use as a central repository of our project releases and source code.

### BitBucket

 - [https://bitbucket.org/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf][100]
 - [https://bitbucket.org/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/wiki][101]

### CodePlex

 - [https://hg.codeplex.com/dotnetrdf][102]

### SourceForge

 - [http://hg.code.sf.net/p/dotnetrdf/code][103]
 - [http://hg.code.sf.net/p/dotnetrdf/binaries-stable][104]
 - [http://hg.code.sf.net/p/dotnetrdf/binaries-nightly][105]

Note that our developers may be maintaining their own additional public/private repositories in order 
to work on new features.

### Old Subversion

You can find our old source code in our SVN repository at
[http://svn.code.sf.net/p/dotnetrdf/svn/][106]

Note that the majority of the commit history should be present in our Mercurial repositories as we did a conversion
of our SVN repository when we moved to Mercurial.  Some commits pre 2010 are missing because our SVN layout
was not consistent with the standard SVN layout prior to that.
