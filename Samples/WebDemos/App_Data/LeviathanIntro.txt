This is a demonstration of the <a href="../../content.asp?pageID=Leviathan">Leviathan</a> SPARQL Engine which the SPARQL Engine used in dotNetRDF.
</p>
<p>
The Leviathan engine supports all of SPARQL 1.0 and SPARQL 1.1 plus a wide variety of extension functions which includes the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../content.asp?pageID=XPath%20Function%20Library">XPath Function Library</a> - many string and numeric XPath functions are supported as well as some basic date time functions</li>
<li>ARQ Function Library - all of the ARQ functions (The Jena framework's SPARQL engine) are supported</li>
<li><a href="../../content.asp?pageID=Leviathan%20Function%20Library">Leviathan Function Library</a> - an extensive library of mostly numeric functions and some useful extension aggregates</li>
<li>An optional <a href="http://www.dotnetrdf.org/content.asp?pageID=Full%20Text%20Querying%20with%20SPARQL">Full Text Query</a> extension which uses <a href="http://lucenenet.apache.org">Lucene.Net</a> and provides <a href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/larq/index.html">LARQ</a> style syntax for full text querying.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This demonstration endpoint may often be running a development build of dotNetRDF so capabilities and behaviour may differ from the public release versions.  To check this please examine the HTTP Headers on this page and you will see a custom <strong>X-dotNetRDF-Version</strong> Header detailing the deployed version.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This Demo has an initial data set which is a couple of small graphs (~500 triples) which we use for testing and debugging.  You can specify Graphs to query from the web by either using FROM and FROM NAMED clauses or by entering a URI in the Default Graph Uri box.  Loading Graphs may take a couple of seconds for the first query after which they will be temporarily cached for appoximately 15 minutes.
